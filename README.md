A single page React app that lets you search for different types of restaurants in your area. It also gives you the ability to sort by most reviewed, top rated and best match.

All information is generated using Yelp's api and is organized into cards that incluide a photo from the restaurant, the address, Yelp rating and review count.

This is my first major project after beginning to learn React through Codecademy!
